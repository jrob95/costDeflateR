Description: This package takes data from the International Monetary Fund's world
  economic output and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
  namely, purchasing power parity exchange rates and gross domestic product
  deflator index values. It uses these values to transform cost values between
  jurisdictions and times, essentially allowing users to adjust between currencies
  and inflation over time.
